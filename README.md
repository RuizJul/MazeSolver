This project consists of the development of a maze-solving game in Java, where an intelligent agent must find the optimal path to escape a maze by using tree-based data structures and the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.

The maze is modeled as a state tree, where each node represents a possible position of the player inside the maze, and each edge represents a valid action or movement. Based on this tree, the Minimax algorithm evaluates different possible paths by considering favorable and unfavorable states, aiming to optimize the agent’s decisions and select the most suitable route.

This project applies fundamental concepts of:

🌳 Trees and data structures

🤖 Basic artificial intelligence

🎯 Search and decision-making algorithms

☕ Object-oriented programming in Java

Main Features

Maze representation using a tree structure.

Implementation of the Minimax algorithm for decision evaluation.

State evaluation using costs, rewards, or penalties.

Simulation of an intelligent agent that makes optimal decisions to solve the maze.

Modular and object-oriented Java code.

Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of trees and the Minimax algorithm in a game-based environment, strengthening the understanding of search algorithms, data structures, and artificial intelligence logic within an academic context.
